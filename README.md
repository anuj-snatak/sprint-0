# SOP for Managing Services in Ubuntu using `systemctl`

This document provides a complete Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for managing system services (daemons) on Ubuntu using `systemctl`. It includes viewing, starting, stopping, enabling, disabling, and troubleshooting services â€” essential for DevOps engineers, system administrators, and students.

## Objective

To define a clear and repeatable SOP to manage Linux services in Ubuntu OS using the `systemctl` command. This ensures consistency, system stability, and operational clarity.

---

## Scope

Applies to:
- Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 LTS  
- Services like: `nginx`, `mysql`, `docker`, `jenkins`, `cron`, `ufw`, `ssh`

---

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu machine with systemd  
- Sudo/root access  
- Terminal access or SSH login  
- Services must be installed

---

## What is a Service?

In Linux, services (also called daemons) are background processes that start on boot or when required. Examples include:

| Service     | Purpose              |
|-------------|----------------------|
| nginx       | Web Server           |
| mysql       | Database Server      |
| docker      | Container Engine     |
| ssh         | Remote Access        |
| jenkins     | CI/CD Automation     |

## systemctl Command Reference

| Action              | Command                                 | Description                           |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Start               | `sudo systemctl start <service>`        | Start the service immediately          |
| Stop                | `sudo systemctl stop <service>`         | Stop the running service               |
| Restart             | `sudo systemctl restart <service>`      | Restart the service                    |
| Reload              | `sudo systemctl reload <service>`       | Reload service config without restart  |
| Enable              | `sudo systemctl enable <service>`       | Enable service to start on boot        |
| Disable             | `sudo systemctl disable <service>`      | Disable service from auto-start        |
| Check Status        | `systemctl status <service>`            | Show current status of the service     |
| Check if Enabled    | `systemctl is-enabled <service>`        | Show if service is enabled on boot     |
| View Logs           | `journalctl -u <service>`               | View logs for the service              |

## Common Examples

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable mysql
sudo systemctl restart ssh
sudo systemctl disable jenkins
systemctl status nginx
Service Validation Checklist
Validation Step	Command	Expected Output
Check if running	systemctl status <service>	active (running)
Check if enabled on boot	systemctl is-enabled <service>	enabled
View service logs	journalctl -u <service>	Logs should appear
Validate nginx config	sudo nginx -t	syntax is ok

Troubleshooting
Problem	Suggested Solution
Service fails to start	Use journalctl -xe to see detailed logs
Port already in use	Run sudo lsof -i :<port> or `ss -tuln
Invalid configuration	Test config (e.g., sudo nginx -t)
Not auto-starting on boot	Run sudo systemctl enable <service>

Config File Paths
Service	Configuration File Path
nginx	/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
mysql	/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/
docker	/etc/docker/daemon.json
jenkins	/etc/default/jenkins
ufw	/etc/ufw/ufw.conf
