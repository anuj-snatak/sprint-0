# SOP for Managing Services in Ubuntu using `systemctl`

This document provides a complete Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for managing system services (daemons) on Ubuntu using `systemctl`. It includes viewing, starting, stopping, enabling, disabling, and troubleshooting services â€” essential for DevOps engineers, system administrators, and students.

## Objective

To define a clear and repeatable SOP to manage Linux services in Ubuntu OS using the `systemctl` command. This ensures consistency, system stability, and operational clarity.

---

## Scope

Applies to:
- Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 LTS  
- Services like: `nginx`, `mysql`, `docker`, `jenkins`, `cron`, `ufw`, `ssh`

---

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu machine with systemd  
- Sudo/root access  
- Terminal access or SSH login  
- Services must be installed

---

## What is a Service?

In Linux, services (also called daemons) are background programs that start automatically when the system boots, or run when needed. They handle important tasks without user interaction.

Here are a few common ones:

nginx â€“ A lightweight and fast web server used to host websites, act as a reverse proxy, or handle load balancing.

mysql â€“ A database service that stores and manages data for web apps or software.

docker â€“ Runs containers. It's used to package apps with their dependencies so they work the same on any system.

ssh â€“ Lets you connect to another machine remotely and securely using the terminal.

jenkins â€“ An automation server used for building, testing, and deploying code (CI/CD).

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl start <service>

 Stop a Service
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl stop <service>

 Restart a Service
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl restart <service>
Stops and starts the service again â€” useful for applying changes.

 Reload a Service (Without Restart)
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl reload <service>
Reloads the service configuration without a full restart.

 Enable Service on Boot
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl enable <service>
Configures the system to start the service automatically at boot time.

Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl disable <service>
Prevents the service from starting at boot.

 Check Service Status

Edit
systemctl status <service>
Shows the current status, including active/inactive, logs, and recent activity.

 Check if Service is Enabled
bash
Copy
Edit
systemctl is-enabled <service>
Tells whether the service is set to start automatically.

 View Service Logs
bash
Copy
Edit
