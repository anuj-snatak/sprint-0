1Ô∏è‚É£ Objective
This SOP aims to provide a clear and standardized method to manage services on a Ubuntu Linux system using the systemctl command.
It ensures users can easily start, stop, enable, disable, and monitor services for smoother operations in development, testing, and production environments.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Scope
This SOP applies to all services (daemons) managed on Ubuntu OS using systemd.
It is especially useful for:

System Administrators

DevOps Engineers

Students working on DevOps/Linux practicals

Anyone managing system services on Ubuntu

3Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
Before managing services, ensure the following:

OS: Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 LTS (systemd-enabled)

Terminal or SSH access

Sudo or root privileges

Target service should be installed (e.g., nginx, mysql)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Services in Ubuntu
In Linux, services are background programs (also called daemons). Examples:

nginx ‚Äì Web server

mysql ‚Äì Database

docker ‚Äì Container runtime

jenkins ‚Äì CI/CD automation

cron ‚Äì Scheduler

ssh ‚Äì Remote login

These services are managed using systemd, and the tool used is systemctl.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Basic systemctl Commands
Action	Command	Explanation
Start a service	sudo systemctl start <service>	Runs the service immediately
Stop a service	sudo systemctl stop <service>	Stops the running service
Restart a service	sudo systemctl restart <service>	Stops and starts again
Reload config	sudo systemctl reload <service>	Reloads config without restarting
Enable service	sudo systemctl enable <service>	Starts the service automatically at system boot
Disable service	sudo systemctl disable <service>	Prevents service from starting at boot
Status check	systemctl status <service>	Shows active/inactive status with logs
Is enabled?	systemctl is-enabled <service>	Shows whether service will start at boot
View logs	journalctl -u <service>	Shows log output of the service

üîÅ Replace <service> with actual name, e.g. nginx, docker, mysql.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Example Use Cases
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl start nginx              # Start web server
sudo systemctl enable mysql            # Enable DB service on boot
sudo systemctl restart docker          # Restart Docker engine
sudo systemctl stop jenkins            # Stop Jenkins
systemctl status nginx                 # Check nginx status
7Ô∏è‚É£ How to Validate Services
Check	Command	Expected Output
Is service running?	systemctl status nginx	active (running)
Is service auto-starting?	systemctl is-enabled mysql	enabled
View latest logs	journalctl -u docker --since "10 min ago"	Logs from last 10 min
Is config valid? (nginx)	sudo nginx -t	syntax is ok

8Ô∏è‚É£ Troubleshooting Tips
Issue	Solution
Service failed to start	Check logs: journalctl -xe
Port already in use	Find conflict: sudo lsof -i :80 or `ss -tuln
Permission denied	Add sudo before command
Error in config file	Use validation: nginx -t, mysqld --verbose
Service not starting on boot	Enable it: sudo systemctl enable <service>

9Ô∏è‚É£ Important Config Files (Ubuntu Specific)
Service	Configuration File Path
Nginx	/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
MySQL	/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
Docker	/etc/docker/daemon.json
Jenkins	/etc/default/jenkins
UFW Firewall	/etc/ufw/ufw.conf

üîü Automation Tip
‚úÖ Shell Script Example
bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
SERVICE=$1
ACTION=$2
sudo systemctl $ACTION $SERVICE
Usage: ./service.sh nginx restart

‚úÖ Ansible Example
yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Ensure nginx is running
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: yes
